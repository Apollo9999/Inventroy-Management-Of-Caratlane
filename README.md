# Inventroy-Management-Of-Caratlane


The main objective of the project is to create for each store of Caratlane, we have a different amount of inventory. 
And all ou rinventory is recorded in our system. In this system, we have the product image,bar code, price, and 
other information related to an available product. In the store, we have the physical product along with their barcode tags and SKUcodes.
Whenever a sale happens, the sold product is archived from the system.Now the issue is, we do not have a register 
(or such) for where the product is located in the store room. Which rack and which row of which rack? Stock 
Reconciliation, which is whether the inventory that is mentioned in the system is present in the store as well. It's a 
manual and long process that we do every day to ensure all the products are available.
Problems to be addressed are mentioned as follows :-
1. Smart counting of stocks and verifying it against the system,
2. Automatic identification of the availability of a particular piece/item against the racks in our physical store
